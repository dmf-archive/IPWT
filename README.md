## What is IPWT?

> **TL;DR:** Consciousness is the synergistic information generated within a workspace instance for minimizing predictive error.

## Project Timeline

- **June 5, 2025**: IPWT proposed.
- **June 7, 2025**: Formalization completed.
- **June 8, 2025**: Manuscript moved to this standalone repository; OpenPoPI development initiated.
- **June 18, 2025**: IPWT has completed its "PoPI", aligning with the solid experimental evidence from [Dr. Luppi](https://github.com/andrealuppi)'s work "[A synergistic workspace for human consciousness revealed by Integrated Information Decomposition.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88173)".
- **June 25, 2025**: Manuscript underwent a thorough rewrite and workflow changes. Completed the two core computation packages: [ΩID](https://github.com/dmf-archive/OmegaID) and [ΣPI](https://github.com/dmf-archive/SigmaPI).
- **August 4, 2025**: Friston's [*A beautiful loop*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106296) confirmed our trajectory. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

## Acknowledgements

The nascent form of this theoretical framework was initially developed as a foundational setting for the science fiction world-building project "Chain://". This project is dedicated to exploring the profound impacts that the core concept of **Formalized Realism** might trigger at social, technological, and philosophical levels. In the process of constructing the inherent logic and operating rules for the "Chain://" universe, we gradually refined and formalized the core ideas of this framework. Therefore, the birth of this research is inseparable from the vast imaginative space and rigorous logical deduction requirements provided by science fiction creation.

We extend our sincere gratitude to all artificial intelligence systems involved in this cross-disciplinary exploration, which made it possible to transform fictional world settings into a serious scientific theory. The resulting technical applications and sociological unit tests are documented in the [Chain://](https://github.com/dmf-archive/dmf-archive.github.io/) project.
