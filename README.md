## What is IPWT?

The Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT) is a unified framework for the science of consciousness. It integrates Predictive Coding Theory (PCT)/Free Energy Principle (FEP) as the dynamic basis for consciousness generation and maintenance, and Workspace Theory (WT) as the architectural platform for information integration and broadcasting. A core innovation of IPWT is the reinterpretation of Integrated Information Theory (IIT)'s core axioms, introducing the concept of "logical irreducibility of information integration" based on Synergy, replacing its physical causal irreducibility. This allows IPWT to apply to information flow and computational levels, freeing it from strict reliance on specific physical causal topologies and overcoming the computational intractability of original IIT. IPWT aims to provide a computationally feasible and clinically powerful model of consciousness, offering a unified paradigm for consciousness science and theoretical guidance for mental disorder interventions.
