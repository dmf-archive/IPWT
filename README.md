## What is IPWT?

The Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT) presents a unified framework for the science of consciousness. It systematically integrates Predictive Coding Theory (PCT) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as the dynamic foundation for the generation and maintenance of conscious content, alongside Workspace Theory (WT) as the architectural platform for information integration and global broadcasting.

A pivotal innovation of IPWT involves the computational reconstruction of Integrated Information Theory (IIT)'s phenomenological axioms. This is achieved by introducing the concept of "logical irreducibility of information integration," grounded in synergistic information, which supersedes IIT's original reliance on physical causal indivisibility. This reinterpretation enables IPWT to be applied at the information flow and computational levels, thereby liberating it from strict dependence on specific physical causal topologies and effectively addressing the computational intractability inherent in the original IIT.

IPWT is designed to offer a computationally feasible and clinically robust model of consciousness, providing a unified paradigm for consciousness science and theoretical guidance for the understanding and intervention of mental disorders, while also possessing significant philosophical depth.
