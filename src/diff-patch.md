    \textit{IPWT posits that a conscious system's reality is defined by its verifiable information, not its physical carrier. We apply this principle to the theory itself. ``Rui Lin'' is a deliberate persona; the author's identity is irrelevant to the theory's logical integrity. Its proof-of-existence is immutably timestamped on \href{https://github.com/dmf-archive/IPWT}{GitHub}.}
    
    \textit{A self-consistent system is its own final proof.}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The formation of this theoretical framework benefited from an interdisciplinary project exploring the intersection of theoretical construction and narrative possibilities. This project aimed to examine the emergent behaviors of formalized theories within complex narrative systems. The author also thanks the inspiring dialogues with several advanced large language models during the research process, which greatly contributed to the clarification of ideas and the refinement of the theory.
