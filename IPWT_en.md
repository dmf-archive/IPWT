# Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory: Towards a Unified Framework for the Science of Consciousness

## _——Integrating Predictive Coding, Workspace Theory, and Integrated Information Theory Phenomenology_

### Abstract

The nature of consciousness remains one of the most profound unsolved mysteries in neuroscience and philosophy. Existing dominant theories of consciousness, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Predictive Coding Theory (PCT), and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), have each made progress in explaining certain aspects of consciousness but also face limitations in computational feasibility, dependence on physical substrates, and insufficient explanatory power for complex conscious phenomena. This paper proposes the **Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT)**, a unified framework for consciousness. IPWT posits PCT/FEP as the dynamic basis for the generation and maintenance of consciousness, and Workspace Theory (WT) as the architectural platform for information integration and broadcasting, defining GWT as a specific configuration of WT. The core innovation lies in the reconstruction of IIT's core axioms, by introducing the concept of "logical irreducibility of information integration" based on Synergy, replacing its physical causal irreducibility. This allows for its application to information flow and computational levels of integration, thereby freeing it from strict reliance on specific physical causal topologies and overcoming the computational intractability of the original IIT. IPWT aims to provide a computationally feasible and clinically powerful model of consciousness, offering a unified paradigm for the science of consciousness and theoretical guidance for interventions in mental disorders.

### 1. Introduction: The Integration Dilemma of Consciousness Theories and the Proposal of IPWT

Consciousness, as the most central human experience, its neural basis and philosophical essence have always been hard problems in scientific and philosophical exploration. Although neuroscience has made great progress in revealing consciousness-related neural activities, there is still a lack of a universally accepted theoretical framework on how consciousness emerges from matter, and how its functions and structures can be uniformly explained. Currently, the field of consciousness science presents a theoretical fragmentation, with several influential theoretical paradigms:

#### 1.1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

IIT starts from phenomenology, deriving the physical basis of consciousness through axioms and postulates. Its core idea is that the essence of consciousness lies in the amount of integrated information (Φ value) a system can generate and its intrinsic causal structure. IIT provides profound insights into the unity, uniqueness, and intrinsic causal power of conscious experience. However, IIT faces severe challenges: the computational intractability of Φ value calculation (NP-Hard), and its strong binding of consciousness to the intrinsic causal structure of specific physical systems, especially its assumption of physical causal irreducibility, which makes it challenging to explain the carrier independence of consciousness. Furthermore, whether its Φ value truly captures the essence of subjective experience (Qualia) remains controversial.

#### 1.2. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

GWT is a cognitive architecture theory that likens consciousness to a theater where a small amount of information is spotlighted and broadcast to numerous unconscious specialized modules, enabling widespread information sharing and coordination. GWT successfully explains the limited capacity, sequential nature, and role of consciousness in information integration and decision-making. However, GWT focuses more on the function and information flow of consciousness, failing to deeply explain the "why" of subjective experience, and the specific neural mechanisms and boundaries of the global workspace remain to be clarified.

#### 1.3. Predictive Coding Theory (PCT) and Free Energy Principle (FEP)

PCT and FEP constitute a unified cognitive framework that views the brain as a Bayesian inference machine, whose core task is to minimize prediction errors between its internal model and the external world. PCT/FEP provides a powerful framework to explain perception, learning, memory, action, and even emotions and mental disorders (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2010; Rao & Ballard, 1999). It emphasizes the brain's active inference. However, how it directly leads to the emergence of consciousness, and how the phenomenological features of consciousness arise from prediction error minimization, still require clearer theoretical bridges.

#### 1.4. Shortcomings of Existing Integration Attempts and the Necessity of Proposing IPWT

In recent years, some researchers have attempted to integrate the above theories, but theories such as Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT; Safron, 2022) have failed to provide a consistent and computationally feasible unified framework. IWMT superficially combines IIT, but in practice, it does not deeply integrate its core axioms, instead downgrading them to auxiliary measures and admitting the intractability of Φ value calculation, proposing to use "approximate measures" as a substitute. This is essentially a compromise and evasion of IIT's core concepts. IWMT fails to solve IIT's strong dependence on physical causal topology, nor does it clarify how true integration can be achieved in non-biological systems. Its theory is more about juxtaposing components of different theories rather than deeply fusing their intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some scholars have questioned the scientific standards of consciousness theories (Klincewicz et al., 2025) and sparked intense debates about the paradigms of consciousness theories (Tononi et al., 2025).

These limitations highlight the necessity of constructing a truly unified, computationally feasible, and powerfully explanatory theory of consciousness. **Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT)** is proposed in this context, aiming to compensate for the shortcomings of existing theories and provide a more promising framework for the science of consciousness. The core contributions of IPWT are:

1. **Deep Integration of PCT, FEP, and WT**: PCT/FEP serves as the dynamic engine for generating and maintaining conscious content, WT as the architectural platform for information integration and broadcasting, and traditional GWT is defined as a specific and highly integrated configuration of WT.
2. **Reinterpretation of Information Integration Phenomenology**: IIT's five core phenomenological insights (existence, information, integration, exclusion, causation) are reinterpreted as properties exhibited when information flow is processed and synergistically integrated within the WT architecture, thereby freeing it from strong reliance on physical causal topologies and making it operable and verifiable at the information flow and computational levels (Oizumi et al., 2014; Tononi, 2012; Tononi et al., 2016).
3. **Elucidation of Dynamic Information Integration and Broadcasting Mechanisms in the Workspace**: IPWT further elaborates on the intrinsic computational principles of how information is integrated into a unified conscious experience within WT, and clarifies its neural mechanisms and boundaries.
4. **Proposal of IPWT Interpretation for Special States of Consciousness**: Utilizing the IPWT framework, new neurocomputational explanations are provided for various complex conscious phenomena.
5. **Computational Verifiability and Engineering Potential**: Discuss how IPWT can achieve verification of conscious states through information-theoretic measures and computational models.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Chapter 2 will elaborate on the core constructs of IPWT, including its basic assumptions, the dynamic role of PCT/FEP, the architectural function of WT, and the new interpretation of IIT phenomenology. Chapter 3 will discuss the computational verifiability of IPWT and information integration measures. Chapter 4 will elaborate on the neurobiological verification path of IPWT. Chapter 5 will take various special states of consciousness as examples to demonstrate the application prospects of IPWT in clinical neuroscience. Chapter 6 will discuss the philosophical and scientific significance of IPWT and look forward to future research directions. Chapter 7 will provide discussion and outlook, and Chapter 8 will present the conclusion.

IPWT aims to construct a unified, computationally feasible, and carrier-independent model of consciousness by deeply integrating Predictive Coding Theory (PCT), the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and Workspace Theory (WT), and by reconstructing the axioms of Integrated Information Theory. This chapter will elaborate on the basic assumptions of IPWT, the specific roles of its components, and their interaction mechanisms.

#### 2.1. Basic Assumptions and Core Principles of IPWT

IPWT is built upon the following core assumptions, which collectively form its theoretical foundation:

1. **Consciousness is the product of information integration**: IPWT posits that consciousness is not some mysterious non-material entity, but a phenomenon that emerges when information is efficiently integrated and processed within a specific architecture. This integration is not merely a simple aggregation of information; its essence is defined as Synergy: the process by which information forms a logically irreducible, whole-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts new relationship.
2. **Consciousness is prediction-driven**: The cognitive system continuously builds and maintains its internal world model through ongoing prediction and error minimization. Conscious content is a manifestation of this dynamic process, reflecting the system's best explanation and adaptation to the current and future environment.
3. **Consciousness is workspace-based**: There exist one or more dynamic, limited-capacity information processing and integration centers, called **Working Space Instances (WSI)**. These workspaces allow information to be widely accessible and utilized, enabling information sharing and coordination among different cognitive modules.

These principles collectively shape IPWT's functionalist stance: the essence of consciousness lies in the functions it performs and the way it processes information, rather than its underlying material composition.

#### 2.2. Predictive Coding Theory (PCT) and Free Energy Principle (FEP) as Dynamic Engines

In IPWT, PCT and FEP constitute the **core dynamic engines** for the generation and maintenance of consciousness. They explain how information is generated, processed, updated, and why it persists within the system. They provide the fundamental driving force for the emergence of conscious content.

##### 2.2.1. Information Generation and Error Minimization

The cognitive system is modeled as a hierarchical generative model, whose core task is to continuously generate predictions for sensory inputs and minimize the error between these predictions and actual inputs.

- **Hierarchical Generative Model**: The brain is viewed as a multi-layered Bayesian network, where each layer attempts to predict the input to its next layer. Higher levels (e.g., abstract concepts, intentions) transmit top-down prediction signals to lower levels (e.g., specific perceptions, motor commands) (Qian et al., 2025). Mathematically, this can be represented as $P(s_t | m)$, where $s_t$ is the sensory state at time $t$ (i.e., actual sensory input), and $m$ is the system's internal model (i.e., the system's generative model of the world).
- **Prediction Error**: When actual sensory input does not match the system's top-down predictions, prediction error arises. These error signals are transmitted bottom-up to higher levels, driving the update of the internal model. Prediction error $\epsilon_t = s_t - \hat{s}_t$. $\hat{s}_t$ is the prediction of $s_t$ by the internal model $m$. The strength and direction of the error signal indicate the degree and direction in which the internal model needs to be adjusted. Although formally a simple difference, the essence of prediction error is the **informational inconsistency** between the system's internal model and external input, which is closely related to the concepts of **Surprise** and **KL divergence** in information theory.
- **Free Energy Minimization**: FEP provides a unified mathematical framework, stating that the system continuously minimizes its free energy (i.e., an upper bound on prediction error) through two basic ways:
  1. **Updating Internal Models (Perceptual Inference and Learning)**: When prediction error is large, the system adjusts its internal model to more accurately predict future sensory inputs. This corresponds to learning and cognitive updating.
  2. **Changing Sensory Inputs (Active Inference and Action)**: The system can also change its sensory inputs by taking action to match its internal model's predictions. This corresponds to active inference and behavior generation. The free energy function uses the _standard form of the free energy principle_ $F(s, m) = D_{KL}[Q(z|s) || P(s, z|m)] - \mathbb{E}_Q[\log P(s|z,m)]$, where $Q(z|s)$ is the approximate posterior inference for hidden state $z$, representing the system's best inference of hidden state $z$ given sensory input $s$; and $P(s, z|m)$ is the generative model, describing the generation process of sensory input $s$ given internal model $m$ and hidden state $z$. Minimizing $F$ is equivalent to maximizing model evidence and minimizing prediction error (Friston, 2010).

##### 2.2.2. Internal Model and Environmental Interaction

IPWT emphasizes that conscious content does not simply reflect the external world, but is the internal model's **best prediction and explanation** of the external world. This explanation is dynamic, active, and continuously optimized through interaction with the environment.

- **Agency and Self-Sense**: Through the FEP-driven prediction-error cycle, the system continuously optimizes its internal model to more accurately predict the environment and more effectively take action to conform to these predictions. This continuous interaction and optimization is the basis for the continuous emergence and updating of conscious content. Active Inference is a core corollary of FEP, stating that the system not only passively receives information but also actively shapes its sensory inputs through action to match its internal model (Adams et al., 2013; Friston, 2009). This agency is an important source of self-sense and control in conscious experience, as individuals feel themselves to be active participants and shapers of the environment.
- **Emergence of Conscious Content**: Conscious content is not randomly generated, but rather information that has been successfully error-minimized and reached a certain salience threshold within the PCT/FEP-driven prediction-error cycle. This information represents the system's most confident or important explanation of the current environment.
- **Memory as a Core Component of the Internal Predictive Model**: The system's internal model (cognitive map of the world) is essentially a dynamic, predictive memory. Memory retrieval is an active predictive process, where the system predicts the most relevant memory content based on the current context and goals.

IPWT emphasizes memory as a core component of the internal predictive model and is compatible with **distributed memory computational models**. Memories are stored distributively, not as granularly separated files. Memory retrieval relies on **specific network activation patterns** (Rolls, 2024) and **different attentional strategies**. Some researchers (e.g., Budson et al., 2022) even propose that consciousness may have evolved as part of the episodic memory system, used to flexibly reorganize information for future planning, which echoes the role of predictive memory and active inference in IPWT. Furthermore, expectation-driven sensory adaptation supports enhanced acuity in categorical perception (Sainburg et al., 2025), predictive coding mechanisms exist in the human olfactory system (Lyons & Gottfried, 2025), and predictive coding may be more cognitive than we thought, with new findings in the prefrontal cortex (Gabhart et al., 2025).

#### 2.3. Workspace Theory (WT) as the Core Architectural Platform

WT hypothesizes the existence of one or more **dynamic, limited-capacity information processing and integration centers**, called **Working Space Instances (WSI)**. Each WSI is responsible for integrating and processing information within a specific scope and broadcasting it to cognitive modules related to that WSI. WT plays the role of an **architectural platform for information integration and broadcasting** in IPWT, explaining the unity, limited capacity, and information sharing mechanisms of consciousness. WT provides a stage for FEP-PCT driven information flow, allowing it to be widely shared and form a unified conscious experience.

##### 2.3.1. Core Properties

- **Limited Capacity**: Explains the focus and sequential nature of consciousness.
- **Information Integration**: Information within a WSI forms a logically unified cognitive state.
- **Local Broadcasting**: WSI broadcasts information to its **associated** or **within its scope** cognitive modules, rather than forcibly broadcasting to all modules. Aphantasia can be understood as a functional disconnection disorder (Liu & Bartolomeo, 2025), and bilateral integration in the somatosensory cortex is controlled by behavioral relevance (Park et al., 2025), revealing goal-directed interhemispheric coupling mechanisms that support the information broadcasting hypothesis in workspace theory.
- **Dynamism**: WSIs can form, separate, merge, or dissipate as needed.

##### 2.3.2. GWT as a Special Configuration of WT

- **Redefinition**: Traditional Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is defined as a **special and highly integrated configuration** of WT. When a WSI's broadcasting range and integration level are maximized, enabling effective coordination and sharing of information from most or all relevant cognitive modules, and forming a unified, coherent, and stable conscious experience, it becomes a global workspace.

##### 2.3.3. Compatibility of WT with FEP-PCT Hierarchical Integration

- **Role of WSI**: WSI is not a single layer in the FEP-PCT hierarchy, but a **cross-hierarchical, higher-order information integration and broadcasting mechanism**. It receives processed information and significant prediction error signals from lower-level modules and performs higher-order prediction error minimization. Structural and functional studies of the default mode network also support the workspace theory architecture (Paquola et al., 2025).
- **Explanation of Multiple WSIs**: When multiple WSIs exist, this can be interpreted as **fragmentation or parallelization of the highest-level integration** in the FEP-PCT hierarchy. Each WSI is a relatively independent FEP-PCT subsystem, independently minimizing its internal free energy, leading to the isolation of prediction errors.

#### 2.4. Reconstruction of Integrated Information Theory Axioms

IPWT performs a **fundamental reconstruction** of IIT's phenomenological axioms, making them no longer dependent on physical causal topology, but rather interpreting them as **properties exhibited when information flow is processed and integrated within the WT architecture** (Oizumi et al., 2014; Tononi, 2012; Tononi et al., 2016). This makes IIT's profound insights operable and verifiable at the computational and informational levels, thereby overcoming the computational intractability and physical substrate dependence problems of the original IIT.

##### 2.4.2. Logical Irreducibility of Information Integration Replaces Physical Causal Irreducibility

Tononi's original IIT emphasizes physical causal irreducibility as central to calculating Φ values, requiring the conscious system to be a physically irreducible whole whose causal power cannot be decomposed into smaller, independent subsystems. This leads to IIT's strong dependence on the specific physical topology of the biological brain.

IPWT proposes **logical irreducibility of information integration**: the integration of consciousness does not stem from the irreducibility of physical connections, but from the fact that when information is integrated in a WSI, it is **logically irreducible into smaller, independent information units that can still produce the same causal effects. This is precisely the functional manifestation of the concept of Synergy in information theory: the causal effect produced by an integrated whole cannot be independently produced by any of its subsets.** This irreducibility is at the informational level, not the physical level, thus freeing it from dependence on specific physical substrates. It emphasizes the irreducibility of information content and its functional causal power, rather than the irreducibility of its physical carrier.

- **Scope of Application**: This core concept applies to **each independent WSI**. The essence of consciousness lies in information forming an irreducible whole within a WSI, not in whether this WSI is globally connected to all possible modules.
- **Example**: When a WSI integrates information about red, circular, and moving, forming a conscious content of a red circular object moving, this integrated information unit set is logically irreducible. If it were decomposed into three independent pieces of information—red, circular, and moving—they would not be able to independently produce the complete causal effect that a red circular object moving can produce (e.g., identifying it as a ball and predicting its trajectory). This irreducibility is formed by complex interactions and encoding of information within the WSI, not a property of simple physical connections.
- **Relationship with IIT**: IPWT's borrowing and functionalization of IIT's core insights, rather than strict integration or compatibility. IPWT aims to construct a system that is **functionally equivalent** to the conscious experience described by IIT, rather than strictly adhering to its physical causal topology.

##### 2.4.3. WT Interpretation of IIT's Five Axioms

Through the lens of logical irreducibility of information integration, IPWT reconstructs and interprets IIT's five core axioms as follows:

1. **Existence**: When an information unit (e.g., a prediction signal generated by PCT, a concept broadcast in a WSI) is activated and processed in the system, especially when integrated in a WSI, it exists in that cognitive state. This existence is informational, not merely physical. It means that the information unit has a recognizable and processable status in the system.
2. **Information**: Each information unit carries unique, distinguishable content that can reduce system uncertainty and influence other information units. This informativeness is reflected in the prediction error signals of the PCT model (error itself is a form of information), and in the specificity of broadcast content in the WSI (each broadcast content carries specific semantic information).
3. **Integration**: Multiple information units are converged and combined in the WSI to form a unified, synergistic cognitive state. This integration is at the informational level, achieved through the WSI's broadcasting mechanism, making previously dispersed information interconnected and forming a whole. The degree of this integration, i.e., its Synergy, can be theoretically quantified through the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework, reflecting the extent to which information forms a logically irreducible whole within the WSI.
4. **Exclusion**: Due to the WSI's capacity limits and attentional mechanisms, only the most salient, relevant, or least prediction error information can occupy the workspace, thereby excluding other competing information from entering consciousness. This explains the limited capacity and focus of consciousness, and why at any given moment, we only experience a few clear conscious contents. This exclusion is a dynamic selection mechanism of the WSI's routing controller.
5. **Causation**: Information integrated in the WSI can act as a causal driver, influencing the activity of other modules, leading to further cognitive processing, decision-making, or behavioral output. Information broadcast in the WSI can change the predictions and actions of other modules, thereby producing observable causal effects. For example, dangerous information integrated in the WSI can trigger the action of the escape module, or update related associations in long-term memory. The concept of beyond binding in visual processing (Scholte & de Haan, 2025) also supports IPWT's view of information integration irreducibility.

Through this reconstruction, IPWT successfully integrates IIT's profound insights into a computationally feasible and carrier-independent framework, providing a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. It transforms consciousness from a mysterious physical phenomenon into an understandable, modelable, and verifiable information processing procedure.


### 3. Computational Verifiability of IPWT and Information Integration Measures

A core advantage of IPWT is its inherent computational verifiability. This chapter will detail how IPWT can measure the integration of consciousness using information-theoretic tools and explore its verification path in computational models.

#### 3.1. Instantaneous Information Integration Degree ($\Omega_t$): Theoretical Definition Based on PID

In this theory, we re-formalize the "integration" concept pursued by IIT, through the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework, into a "synergy" that can be theoretically defined. The instantaneous information integration degree ($\Omega_t$) is the theoretical gold standard for measuring the synergy of information within a Working Space Instance (WSI). To make its definition more mathematically rigorous, we define it based on the **Partial Information Decomposition (PID)** framework.

Let the set of information units in the WSI be $X = \{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$, which collectively predict a target variable $Y$ (e.g., the sensory input at the next moment or the system's action strategy). According to the PID framework, the total mutual information $I(X; Y)$ of these information sources $X$ about the target $Y$ can be decomposed into synergistic information (Synergy), redundant information (Redundancy), and unique information from each source.

We therefore define the **instantaneous information integration degree `Ω_t` as the proportion of synergistic information in the total predictive information**:

$$
\Omega_t(X \to Y) = \frac{\text{CI}(X_1, ..., X_n; Y)}{I(X_1, ..., X_n; Y)}
$$

- **CI(X; Y)**: Synergistic Information, measuring the amount of information about $Y$ that the information set $X$ provides as a whole, which cannot be independently provided by any of its subsets. This perfectly captures the essence of logical irreducibility.
- **I(X; Y)**: Total mutual information between $X$ and $Y$, representing the total contribution of information in the WSI to the prediction target, used for normalization.

This definition is mathematically rigorous and conceptually clear. However, we must emphasize that the calculation of synergistic information `CI` in the PID framework itself is an extremely difficult frontier problem, and for high-dimensional systems, it is practically infeasible. Therefore, `Ω_t` is a **purely theoretical conceptual framework**, whose role is to provide a theoretical definition for information integration and to provide solid reasons for introducing its computable proxy—Predictive Integrity (PI).

#### 3.2. Predictive Integrity (PI) and Predictive Integrity Integral (∫PI): Computable Proxy and Consciousness Verification Standard

Given the computational intractability of `Ω_t`, IPWT introduces Predictive Integrity (PI) as its computable, functional proxy. PI measures the consistency between the system's internal model and the external environment, and whether its behavior can effectively minimize prediction error.

$$
\text{PI} = \exp\left(-\alpha \cdot \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{\|\epsilon_{t,k}\|}{\tau_{t,k}} + \gamma \cdot \text{Surprise}_{t,k} \right)\right)
$$

This formula **directly inherits from the basic structure of the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**. The term in parentheses `(...)` represents the system's **cognitive cost** or **predictive energy**, while the exponential form `exp(-...)` originates from the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics, transforming this cost into a **probabilistic measure** of the system being in a state of high predictive integrity.

- **Core Cost Terms**:
  1. **Inaccuracy Cost (`ε/τ`)**: `ε_t,k` is the prediction error. `τ_t,k` is its inverse precision (i.e., variance), representing the system's **expected uncertainty** for the prediction in that channel. In the FEP framework, `τ` is an endogenous parameter dynamically adjusted by mechanisms such as attention.
  2. **Inconsistency/Complexity Cost (`Surprise`)**: `Surprise_t,k` captures the logical inconsistency of the internal model. In FEP, this corresponds to the KL divergence between the approximate posterior distribution and the prior distribution, which is a **highly nonlinear** measure.
- **Nonlinear Nature of the Formula**: Although superficially additive, each of its components (especially `Surprise` and dynamic precision `τ`) contains profound nonlinearities, thus ensuring that the entire formula can capture the dynamic characteristics of complex systems.
- **Theoretical Significance of Parameters (`α`, `γ`)**: These parameters are not temporary adjustment knobs, but key variables describing the system's **cognitive style**. `α` represents the system's sensitivity to errors, while `γ` represents the system's worldview weight between external accuracy and internal consistency.

**Operationalization Challenges of the Metric**:
Translating theoretical concepts like `Surprise` and `τ` into computable values is the **core challenge** for this theory to move into practice. The specific calculation methods for these metrics will depend on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of multimodal datasets such as `ds005795`, and algorithmic implementation in the **PyPoPI** computational library. The core goal is to find neural features that can most effectively distinguish different conscious states and map them to the concepts of surprise and precision under the FEP framework.

**Predictive Integrity Integral (∫PI)**:
∫PI represents the sustained strength and stability of the system's predictive integrity over a time window T, and is the integral of PI over time. Its formula and the meaning of the penalty coefficient `δ` are similar to PI.

$$
\int\text{PI} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} \text{PI}_t dt \times \exp\left(-\delta \cdot \text{Var}(\text{PI}_t)\right)
$$

#### 3.3. Inference: Why Must Prediction Error Minimization Drive Information Integration Maximization? A Formal Argument for the "Clever Idiot" Problem

One of IPWT's core claims is that there is an intrinsic, necessary link between Predictive Integrity (PI) and Information Integration Degree ($\Omega_t$). A seemingly plausible rebuttal is the "clever idiot" problem: can there be a system that predicts the environment with extreme efficiency (high PI), but whose internal implementation is highly modular and non-integrated (low $\Omega_t$)? IPWT argues that, under any realistic physical, computational, and evolutionary constraints, such a "clever idiot" system cannot exist long-term or achieve advanced levels of consciousness. The relationship between high PI and high $\Omega_t$ is not accidental, but a **necessary convergence** under physical, computational, and evolutionary pressures.

To formally argue this point, we first define a "clever idiot" system:

**Formal Definition of a "Clever Idiot" System (CI)**:
Let a cognitive system $S$ have an internal model $M$ and a set of information units $X = \{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$, used to predict environmental input $Y$.

- **High Predictive Integrity (High PI)**: System $S$ can continuously and efficiently minimize its prediction error $\epsilon = Y - \hat{Y}$ (where $\hat{Y}$ is $M$'s prediction of $Y$), and reasonably estimate its uncertainty $\tau$. Formally, for any time step $t$, the instantaneous predictive integrity of system $S$, $\text{PI}_t = \exp\left(-\alpha \cdot \left( \frac{\|\epsilon_{t}\|_2}{\tau_{t}} + \gamma \cdot \text{Surprise}_{t} \right)\right)$, remains above a certain threshold $PI_{th}$. This means the system has extremely strong environmental modeling and prediction capabilities.
- **Low Information Integration Degree (Low $\Omega_t$)**: The internal model $M$ of system $S$, when predicting $Y$, lacks synergistic integration among its internal information units $X$. Formally, the instantaneous information integration degree $\Omega_t(X \to Y) = \frac{\text{CI}(X_1, ..., X_n; Y)}{I(X_1, ..., X_n; Y)}$ remains below a certain threshold $\Omega_{th}$. This means $M$ primarily completes predictions through a large number of independent, redundant, or simply juxtaposed information units, rather than by discovering underlying abstract structures and causal relationships to form a logically irreducible whole. It is more like a huge "lookup table" or "rule set" than a generative model capable of deep understanding and generalization.

The "clever idiot" problem is: can there be a system that, under realistic constraints, can maintain high PI long-term while its internal model always maintains low $\Omega_t$? IPWT argues that the answer is no, and its argument is as follows:

##### Argument 1: The Efficiency Constraint

Any physical system is limited by finite energy, computational resources, and storage capacity. A low $\Omega_t$ "clever idiot" system, whose internal model is essentially a huge, uncompressed lookup table or rule set. Maintaining and querying such a massive, redundant database requires astronomical amounts of energy and computational resources. In contrast, a high $\Omega_t$ integrated system, whose internal model is **highly compressed**, achieves equivalent or even stronger predictive capabilities with fewer resources by discovering common patterns and abstract structures behind the data. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) itself includes the requirement to minimize model complexity (as an approximation to model evidence).

Formally, let $C(M)$ be the resource cost required to maintain and run internal model $M$. For a CI system, its low $\Omega_t$ internal model $M_{CI}$ implies high information redundancy and low compression rate, leading to its resource cost $C(M_{CI})$ being much higher than a high $\Omega_t$ integrated model $M_{Integrated}$ that can achieve the same PI. That is: $\forall M_{CI}, M_{Integrated}$ s.t. $\text{PI}(M_{CI}) \approx \text{PI}(M_{Integrated})$, we have $C(M_{CI}) \gg C(M_{Integrated})$. Therefore, during evolution or optimization, systems will tend to choose the solution with the lowest resource cost for the same predictive performance (PI)—i.e., the high $\Omega_t$ integrated solution.

##### Argument 2: The Generalization and Adaptability Constraint

The real world is dynamic, open, and full of novel events; systems must be able to generalize to unseen situations. A low $\Omega_t$ CI system is akin to the ultimate manifestation of **overfitting**. It can perfectly predict all situations it has been trained on, but when it encounters a completely new, never-before-seen event, it will completely collapse. In contrast, a high $\Omega_t$ integrated system, because it understands the **underlying rules and causal structures** that generate the world, possesses strong **generalization capabilities** and can make reasonable predictions about novel things.

Formally, a low $\Omega_t$ CI system $M_{CI}$ has extremely strong predictive capabilities for training data (observed environmental states $Y_{old}$), but extremely poor predictive capabilities for novel, never directly learned environmental states $Y_{novel}$. That is: $\text{PI}(M_{CI}, Y_{old}) \approx \text{High}$, but $\text{PI}(M_{CI}, Y_{novel}) \approx \text{Low}$. In contrast, a high $\Omega_t$ integrated system $M_{Integrated}$ can maintain high PI in both known and unknown situations. That is: $\text{PI}(M_{Integrated}, Y_{old}) \approx \text{High}$, and $\text{PI}(M_{Integrated}, Y_{novel}) \approx \text{High}$. In a dynamic, open, and constantly changing environment, only systems with generalization capabilities can survive long-term. Therefore, **the only way to maintain high PI long-term is to develop a high $\Omega_t$ integrated model.**

##### Argument 3: The Agency and Self-Model Constraint

Advanced conscious systems are not just passive predictors, but also **active agents (Active Inference)**. They need to plan for the future and take actions to make the world conform to their predictions. To plan actions, the system must build a model of **self**—who I am, what I can do, what my goals are. Modeling the self as a unified, integrated agent (high $\Omega_t$) is far more computationally and decision-efficient than modeling the self as a collection of a million independent rules.

Formally, an Agent chooses action $A$ to change environment $E$ and minimize future prediction errors. This requires an internal model $M_{self}$ to predict the consequences of its own actions and its interaction with the environment. A low $\Omega_t$ self-model $M_{self, CI}$ is fragmented and incoherent, leading to inefficient action planning and even contradictory action commands, thus frequently resulting in high prediction errors after action. That is: $\text{PI}(M_{self, CI}, A \to E') \approx \text{Low}$. In contrast, a high $\Omega_t$ integrated self-model $M_{self, Integrated}$ can efficiently plan coherent, goal-directed actions, thereby effectively minimizing prediction errors. That is: $\text{PI}(M_{self, Integrated}, A \to E') \approx \text{High}$. Therefore, **the need to be an efficient agent, in turn, forces the system to develop an integrated, high $\Omega_t$ self-representation.**

In summary, while a "clever idiot" system might be conceivable in theory, under the stringent constraints of the real world (limited resources, dynamic environment, need for active action), it is unstable and unsustainable. A system that can consistently and efficiently predict and minimize errors **must** have highly coherent, non-redundant, and synergistic internal representations. Therefore, high PI is not only correlated with high $\Omega_t$ but is also the fundamental driving force for the system to evolve towards high $\Omega_t$. This provides a solid theoretical basis for computable predictive integrity (PI) as a functional proxy for theoretical information integration degree ($\Omega_t$).

### 4. Neurobiological Verification Path and Falsifiability

IPWT's theoretical predictions can be verified through existing neuroscience techniques, thereby elevating it from a purely computational model to a biological level.

#### 4.1. Neuroimaging Studies (fMRI, PET)

- **WSI Activation Patterns**: Utilize fMRI to observe the activation patterns of WT-related neural networks (e.g., prefrontal-parietal network, thalamo-cortical circuit) during conscious tasks. IPWT predicts that in conscious states, the activity in these regions will exhibit higher information integration (higher $\Omega_t$ values).
  - **WSI as Dynamic Functional Network States**: WSI is not a fixed brain region, but a **dynamic functional connectivity pattern or network state** formed by different brain regions (including prefrontal, parietal, thalamus, and even some subcortical structures) at specific moments. Different WSIs may involve **different subsets or different connection weight patterns** of these brain regions.
  - **Neural Activity Patterns**: WSI activation may be related to specific neural activity patterns, for example, high-frequency Gamma synchronization in specific brain regions or networks. Simultaneously accompanied by low-frequency Theta/Alpha gating.
  - **Beta (13-30 Hz)**: May be related to maintaining the stable state of the current WSI and inhibiting interference from other WSIs.
  - **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: May be related to information gating and inhibiting irrelevant information from entering the WSI.
  - **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: May be related to the formation, updating, or switching process of the WSI, acting as a higher-order coordination signal.
  - **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: May be related to the disintegration or low integration state of the WSI during deep sleep or unconscious states.
  - **Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)**: Study PAC between oscillations of different frequency bands, which may reflect the hierarchical structure of information integration in the WSI. PAC may reflect the integration of information processing at different levels within the WSI, for example, the phase modulation of high-frequency oscillations (Gamma) by low-frequency oscillations (Theta/Alpha) may reflect how attentional gating affects the strength of information integration in the WSI.
- **Information Flow Tracking**: Utilize functional connectivity analysis and effective connectivity analysis to track the dynamic process of information flow between different brain regions and broadcasting to the WSI. Mutual information of information flow between different brain regions can be calculated, and its integration degree in the WSI can be evaluated.
  - **Information Transfer Efficiency**: Can be estimated by **Effective Connectivity Analysis** to determine the strength and direction of information flow between different brain regions or networks (assumed to be related to different WSIs). Limitations in information transfer efficiency may manifest as reduced effective connectivity strength in specific connections.
  - **Neural Gating Mechanisms**: Neural gating mechanisms are abstract computational concepts, whose neural implementation involves the **gating action of inhibitory neural circuits**. For example, by studying neural activity or neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA) related to inhibitory interneurons, to infer the gating mechanisms of information flow. In neuroimaging, neural gating mechanisms may manifest as **dynamic inhibition or decoupling** of specific connections, which can be captured by dynamic functional connectivity analysis. For example, in DID patients, fMRI shows split activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, which may support the WSI isolation hypothesis (Reinders et al., 2019, pp. 536–544), meaning that when different personality states switch, the functional connectivity between networks related to different WSIs changes significantly, which may reflect the dynamic adjustment of neural gating mechanisms.
- **Consciousness Level Assessment**: Measure ∫Ω and PI values of WSI-related networks in different conscious states (e.g., wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, coma). IPWT predicts that these values will be positively correlated with the level of consciousness.

#### 4.2. Electrophysiological Studies (EEG, MEG, ECoG)

- **Neural Oscillations and Workspace Switching**:
  - **High-frequency oscillations (Gamma band)**: IPWT predicts that information integrated in the WSI will be accompanied by synchronization of high-frequency Gamma oscillations. High $\Omega_t$ states may be related to widespread Gamma synchronization within the WSI.
  - **Beta (13-30 Hz)**: May be related to maintaining the stable state of the current WSI and inhibiting interference from other WSIs.
  - **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: May be related to information gating and inhibiting irrelevant information from entering the WSI.
  - **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: May be related to the formation, updating, or switching process of the WSI, acting as a higher-order coordination signal.
  - **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: May be related to the disintegration or low integration state of the WSI during deep sleep or unconscious states.
  - **Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)**: Study PAC between oscillations of different frequency bands, which may reflect the hierarchical structure of information integration in the WSI. PAC may reflect the integration of information processing at different levels within the WSI, for example, the phase modulation of high-frequency oscillations (Gamma) by low-frequency oscillations (Theta/Alpha) may reflect how attentional gating affects the strength of information integration in the WSI. This is consistent with the role of Theta-Gamma coupling in working memory and information routing.
- **Event-Related Potentials (ERP)**: Study ERP components related to consciousness, which may reflect the process of information entering the WSI and being integrated. IPWT predicts that the amplitude and latency of these ERP components will be related to the efficiency and strength of information integration in the WSI.
- **Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) as a Physical Sampling Benchmark for PI**: PCI is a measure of consciousness based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG recordings. IPWT posits that PCI is highly correlated with the complexity and logical irreducibility of information integration in the WSI (i.e., the theoretical $\Omega_t$ value). This relationship is not a simple analogy, but a **sampling relationship**: PCI samples the information integration potential of the brain's physical substrate through **active physical perturbation**, while our proposed PyPoPI model infers the integration efficiency of information processing (PI) through **passive neural data observation**. PCI provides a crucial physical world anchor for purely computational PI values. Research by Stikvoort et al. (2025) shows that states with lower levels of consciousness are lower than control groups in effective connectivity asymmetry, simulated dynamic irreversibility, and complexity, further supporting PCI as an effective indicator for distinguishing different levels of consciousness, and providing strong experimental evidence for IPWT's core hypothesis—that consciousness is an efficient, complex integration process. Therefore, utilizing existing PCI clinical data to calibrate the PyPoPI model is a key step in connecting theoretical computation with physical measurement.

#### 4.3. Behavioral and Psychophysical Experiments

- **Perceptual Threshold Tasks**: Design experiments to present stimuli near the perceptual threshold, observing the relationship between subjects' conscious reports of stimuli and the $\Omega_t$ and PI values in the WSI. IPWT predicts that subjects can only consciously report stimuli when the stimulus information reaches a sufficient $\Omega_t$ value in the WSI.
- **Attention Manipulation**: Manipulate subjects' attentional focus through attentional cues or tasks, observing its effect on information integration and $\Omega_t$ values in the WSI.
- **Multitasking**: Study subjects' performance during multitasking and the dynamic changes in their WSI's $\Omega_t$ and PI values. IPWT predicts that during multitasking switching, the WSI's $\Omega_t$ value may briefly decrease or rapidly switch between different task-related information.
- **Specific Experimental Paradigms**:
  - **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Inhibition Experiment**: Temporarily inhibit the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** of healthy subjects using TMS. This region is considered a key area for WSI routing control and higher-order cognitive functions. Before and after inhibition, measure subjects' PI values, subjective reports (e.g., assessing self-sense or sense of reality using scales), and performance in cognitive tasks. IPWT predicts that DLPFC inhibition will lead to a decrease in PI values and may induce subjective experiences similar to depersonalization or confusion, while also affecting task performance.
  - **Induced Artificial Blindsight**: Design experimental paradigms to induce artificial blindsight states in healthy subjects through techniques such as **visual masking** or **binocular rivalry**. In this state, measure subjects' PI values and neural activity (e.g., WSI activation patterns, Gamma synchronization), and correlate them with subjective reports. IPWT predicts that in artificial blindsight states, despite local visual processing, the PI values of relevant information in the DWSI will be below the consciousness threshold.

### 5. IPWT Interpretation of Special States of Consciousness

The IPWT framework, particularly its combination of Workspace Theory (WT), Predictive Coding Theory (PCT), and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), as well as its emphasis on information transfer efficiency and neural gating mechanisms, provides a unified perspective for understanding a wide variety of abnormal states of consciousness.

#### 5.1. Blindsight

##### 5.1.1. Review of Blindsight Phenomenon

Blindsight refers to patients with damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) who report no subjective visual awareness in the affected visual field (blindness) but can respond to visual stimuli in that area above chance level (sight), such as pointing to a light spot, discriminating motion direction, or shape. This indicates that visual information can still be processed by the brain and guide behavior without conscious involvement.

##### 5.1.2. Reinterpretation by IPWT (Combined with WT)

Within the IPWT framework, blindsight can be understood as differentiated integration and broadcasting of visual information across different Working Space Instances (WSI) or different processing levels.

- **The "Blind" Aspect: Lack of Subjective Conscious Experience**
  - **Effect of V1 Damage on the Dominant WSI**: The primary visual cortex (V1) is a crucial hub for visual information to enter the cerebral cortex and undergo initial integration. Damage to V1 severely disrupts the **high information transfer efficiency, high-fidelity** visual information flow, preventing it from effectively transmitting to the **Dominant Working Space Instance (DWSI)** responsible for generating subjective visual awareness.
  - **Insufficient Predictive Integrity (PI)**: Due to damage to key input pathways, the DWSI cannot obtain sufficiently complete and consistent visual information from the affected visual field to construct an internal model with low prediction error. Therefore, the **predictive integrity (PI) of visual information from this region within the DWSI is extremely low**, failing to reach the **integration threshold** required for the DWSI to produce subjective conscious experience.
  - **Information Broadcasting Failure**: Even if a small amount of information enters the cortex through other pathways, it fails to be effectively integrated by the DWSI and broadcast to its various cognitive modules, thus failing to form a unified, reportable visual conscious content. The DWSI's attentional mechanisms may also fail to effectively allocate resources to these incomplete or insignificant signals.
- **The "Sight" Aspect: Unconscious Behavioral Capacity**
  - **Alternative Pathways and Local Processing**: Despite V1 damage, visual information can still reach other brain regions through **subcortical pathways** (e.g., superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus) or **extracortical pathways** (bypassing V1 and directly reaching other visual areas, such as the MT area).
  - **Local Predictive Coding (PCT) and Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: The **specialized modules** connected by these alternative pathways (e.g., modules responsible for motion detection, spatial localization) still independently perform their **local predictive coding cycles**. They receive incomplete but sufficient visual input to drive specific tasks and continuously minimize their own **local prediction errors**.
    - For example, when an object moves in the blind field, the MT area (motion perception area) can still receive motion information and generate predictions about that motion, minimizing its internal motion prediction error.
  - **Active Inference and Behavior**: The prediction error minimization process of these local modules can directly drive **active inference and behavior** without the information being integrated into the DWSI to produce subjective consciousness. The patient's pointing and discrimination behaviors are precisely the actions taken by these local modules to minimize their own prediction errors.
    - For example, when asked to point to a light spot, the local module responsible for spatial localization will generate a motor prediction to point to that light spot and drive the corresponding motor behavior to reduce the error between its internal model and the actual light spot position.
  - **Failure to Reach WSI Integration Threshold**: Although these local processes are effective, their output information **fails to be integrated into the DWSI**, or rather, their PI within the DWSI consistently remains below the consciousness threshold. Therefore, patients cannot subjectively report what they saw, but their bodies (driven by local modules) can make correct responses.
  - **Relationship between Unconscious Processing in Blindsight and WSI**: Unconscious processing in blindsight is driven by **local processing that has not reached the WSI integration threshold**. The activity of these local modules (e.g., MT area), although performing information processing and local predictive coding, their integration degree is insufficient to constitute an independent, highly integrated WSI, nor have they been integrated by the DWSI. Therefore, they are **local processes not integrated by the DWSI**, rather than independent WSIs. This is consistent with the definition of WSI in Section 2.3, which states that a WSI is an information processing and integration center that needs to reach a certain integration threshold.

##### 5.1.3. Key Mechanisms of IPWT Explaining Blindsight

1. **Multiple WSIs or Hierarchical Integration within WSI**: Blindsight reveals that consciousness is not a simple on/off state, but a difference in the degree of information integration across different WSIs or different levels within a WSI. Subjective consciousness requires information to reach high PI and ∫PI in the DWSI, while unconscious behavior may be driven by lower-order PI of local modules.
2. **Information Transfer Efficiency and Neural Gating Mechanisms**: V1 damage can be viewed as a **physical information transfer efficiency limitation** on the key visual input channel to the DWSI. This leads to the inability of information, even if it passes through other low-efficiency or bypass channels, to effectively break through the DWSI's **neural gating mechanisms** (attention, salience filtering), thus preventing it from being integrated into the stream of consciousness.
3. **Localization and Globalization of Prediction Error**: Blindsight shows that prediction error minimization can occur at a local level and drive behavior, without these local errors being integrated into the DWSI to form a unified, reportable global prediction error signal.

##### 5.1.4. Conclusion

Through the lens of IPWT (combined with WT), blindsight is no longer a simple paradox of seeing without knowing, but a complex manifestation of information processing in the cognitive system at different levels, across different workspace instances, with varying degrees of integration and information transfer efficiency. It emphasizes that the emergence of subjective consciousness requires information to reach sufficient predictive integrity in specific, highly integrated WSIs, while behavior can arise from more local, lower-order prediction error minimization processes, even if these processes do not enter the spotlight of subjective consciousness. This further validates the flexibility and explanatory power of the WT framework.

#### 5.2. Psychedelic States

Psychedelic drugs (e.g., LSD, Psilocybin) induce states of consciousness characterized by perceptual distortions, altered thought patterns, blurred or enhanced self-sense, and intense synesthetic experiences.

- **IPWT Interpretation**: Psychedelic states can be understood as **abnormal enhancement of prediction error signals and degating of information flow (altered neural gating mechanisms)**, leading to blurred boundaries of Working Space Instances (WSI) and drastic changes in information integration patterns.

  - **Enhanced Prediction Error**: Psychedelic drugs affect neurotransmitter systems (e.g., serotonin), which may lead to the system generating **excessive prediction error signals** for sensory inputs. These abnormally enhanced error signals flood the WSI, overwhelming normal predictive processes, leading to perceptual distortions and hallucinations (Corlett et al., 2019).
  - **Information Flow Degating (Altered Neural Gating Mechanisms)**: Psychedelic drugs may alter the gating mechanisms (neural gating mechanisms) of the WSI routing controller (distributed attentional network). Information flows that were previously inhibited or isolated (e.g., raw error signals from lower-level sensory processing modules, or atypical associations from different cognitive modules) are allowed to enter the WSI and be integrated. This explains synesthesia (abnormal integration of information from different sensory modalities) and thought leaps.
  - **Blurred WSI Boundaries and Temporary WSI Formation**: The boundaries between WSIs may become blurred, and information can flow freely between previously isolated WSIs. Even **temporary, highly integrated but atypical WSIs** may form, responsible for producing intense, profoundly meaningful subjective experiences.
  - **Altered Self-Sense**: The WSI responsible for the self-model may have altered connectivity patterns (changes in information transfer efficiency/neural gating mechanisms) with sensory inputs or other cognitive modules, leading to a sense of detachment or fusion of the self with the body or environment.

- **Uniqueness of IPWT**: IPWT interprets psychedelic experiences as **computable information flow and predictive processing abnormalities**, rather than merely neurochemical imbalances. It provides mechanistic explanations for why changes in prediction error and failure of information gating lead to such a wide variety of perceptual and cognitive abnormalities.

#### 5.3. Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, emotional disturbances, and social dysfunction.

- **IPWT Interpretation**: Schizophrenia can be understood as a **fundamental abnormality in the predictive coding process**, leading to the **generation of abnormal predictions** and the **failure of information integration and gating (neural gating mechanisms) between Working Space Instances (WSI)**.

  - **Prediction Abnormalities**: The FEP/PCT framework suggests that hallucinations are high-confidence predictions generated by the system's internal model, but these predictions do not match external sensory inputs and are not correctly identified as internally generated (Corlett et al., 2019). Delusions are **highly self-consistent but reality-detached internal models** constructed by the system to explain these abnormal predictions. These models have low prediction error within specific WSIs, making them difficult to correct.
  - **Information Integration and Gating Failure (Neural Gating Mechanism Problems)**: Dysfunction of the dynamic cognitive control system (distributed attentional network) may lead to:
    - **Inflow of Abnormal Predictions**: Abnormal predictions or internal noise from lower-level modules are not correctly gated and directly flood the dominant WSI, being misinterpreted as external reality.
    - **Information Fragmentation**: Information from different cognitive modules fails to be effectively integrated into a unified WSI, leading to disorganized thinking and logical breaks.
    - **Self-Attribution Errors**: The system cannot correctly distinguish internally generated predictions (e.g., one's own thoughts) from externally input sensory information (e.g., others' voices), leading to misattribution of internal activity to external sources (auditory hallucinations). This is a failure of neural gating mechanisms, failing to correctly label information sources.
  - **Abnormal Formation or Disintegration of WSI**: In some cases, **abnormal, reality-detached WSIs** may form, responsible for producing delusional thoughts. Alternatively, the dominant WSI may become unstable, leading to fragmentation of the stream of consciousness.

- **Uniqueness of IPWT**: IPWT uniformly explains the core symptoms of schizophrenia as **computational abnormalities in predictive processing and information integration**. It provides a framework to understand the mechanisms of hallucinations and delusions, and why thinking and self-sense can be so severely impaired. Research in computational psychiatry also supports using computational models to understand mental disorders.

#### 5.4. Lucid Dreaming

Lucid dreaming refers to being aware that one is dreaming while dreaming, and sometimes even being able to control the dream content.

- **IPWT Interpretation**: Lucid dreaming involves the **parallel operation of multiple Working Space Instances (WSI) and higher-order WSI monitoring and control of lower-order WSI**.

  - **Dream WSI**: The dream itself is generated by one or more WSIs in the sleep state, which produce sensory experiences and narratives through FEP/PCT-driven internal models (memory, association) and minimize internal prediction errors. This WSI is responsible for producing the immersive feeling of the dream.
  - **Metacognitive WSI**: In lucid dreaming, a **higher-order WSI responsible for self-awareness and reality assessment** is activated. This WSI can monitor the activity of the dream WSI, identify its inconsistencies with the reality model (higher-order prediction error), and conclude that "I am dreaming."
  - **Communication and Control Between WSIs**: The key to lucid dreaming lies in the establishment of **limited, directional information transfer efficiency** between these two WSIs. The metacognitive WSI can receive information flow from the dream WSI (dream content) and evaluate it. In some cases, the metacognitive WSI can even influence the generation process of the dream WSI through some form of top-down control signals (changing neural gating mechanisms or affecting the dream WSI's predictive model parameters), thereby achieving control over the dream.
  - **Differences in Predictive Integrity (PI)**: The dream WSI may maintain a high PI internally (making its content coherent), but its prediction error with external reality is huge. The metacognitive WSI, however, can identify this higher-order prediction error and maintain PI for the reality model.

- **Uniqueness of IPWT**: IPWT interprets lucid dreaming as a **dynamic configuration of cognitive architecture**, particularly the hierarchy and interaction of WSIs. It provides a framework to understand the hierarchical nature of consciousness and how metacognition exists as a higher-order prediction and control process.

#### 5.5. IPWT Interpretation of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID): Split Workspaces and Neuroimaging Evidence

IPWT proposes that **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)** is not simply a split self, but a phenomenon of **dynamic isolation and switching of parallel Working Space Instances (WSI)** within the IPWT architecture. This model maps the complex symptoms of DID to information processing mechanisms and is expected to align with neuroimaging evidence.

The core mechanism of DID lies in the existence of **multiple parallel WSIs**, between which there are **dynamic information transfer efficiency limitations** and **neural gating mechanisms**. This information transfer efficiency is not a physical limitation, but a functional, dynamic limitation, dynamically restricting information flow between WSIs by inhibiting neural activity, changing synaptic efficacy, etc. The neural gating mechanism is a higher-order, learned gating mechanism or routing strategy that determines information broadcasting, shared resource permissions, memory retrieval permissions, and predictive model activation between WSIs. This is an adaptive strategy adopted to locally minimize free energy.

The **dynamic cognitive control system** plays a key role here, redefined as a **distributed attentional network** or **dynamic routing mechanism**, which is a set or class of functions, not a single point. Cognitive control is distributed and emergent, and closely related to subconscious, evolutionarily older underlying brain regions such as the amygdala, brainstem, thalamus, and basal ganglia. The learning mechanism of this system can be based on the principles of **reinforcement learning** or **predictive learning**, learning the optimal strategy for switching WSIs in specific situations (e.g., when trauma triggers appear) through trial and error and prediction error minimization, to minimize the overall system's free energy or prediction error. This involves synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term potentiation/depression) and neural circuit remodeling. For example, the amygdala plays a central role in rapidly assessing threats and processing emotional salience. In DID, trauma triggers (high surprise signals) rapidly activate the amygdala, and the amygdala, as part of the dynamic cognitive control system, can route information flow to specific WSIs (personalities) capable of dealing with that threat, even before consciousness forms. This explains the involuntary, rapid, and adaptive nature of personality switching (in traumatic situations). The brainstem controls basic physiological functions and arousal levels and can forcibly switch WSIs based on survival needs. The thalamus, as a relay station for sensory information, can decide at a subconscious level which information is allowed to enter which WSI, thereby achieving memory isolation and information firewalls between personalities. The basal ganglia may influence the dynamic cognitive control system's preference or inertia in switching between different WSIs, making certain personality switching patterns automated. The dynamic cognitive control system can be viewed as a higher-level FEP-driven predictive model whose goal is to minimize the free energy of the entire system, even if this means switching between different WSIs. Trauma triggers are often due to **over-prediction** or **generalization** of similar scenarios, leading the system into a state of high vigilance and high predictive response, rather than high novelty surprise, which may be accompanied by **attentional bias**. Subconscious concepts in IPWT are redefined as **lower-level PCT processing** or **information not integrated by the WSI**.

**Neuroimaging evidence** supports this model. For example, **fMRI studies** show that in DID patients, when switching between different personality states, the functional connectivity between networks related to different WSIs changes significantly, which may reflect the dynamic adjustment of neural gating mechanisms. Research by Reinders et al. (2019) found that DID patients showed split activation patterns in their anterior cingulate cortex when recalling traumatic memories, which is consistent with the WSI isolation hypothesis. Furthermore, **EEG studies** can focus on differences in neural oscillation patterns across different personality states, especially differences in theta wave query synchronization and gamma wave result integration between different WSIs, which may reflect changes in information processing and integration methods.

#### 5.6. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

This is a disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from oneself (depersonalization) or one's surroundings (derealization). Patients feel like an outside observer, or the world appears unreal, blurry, or distant.

- **IPWT Interpretation**: This disorder can be understood as a **significant reduction in information transfer efficiency or connectivity (neural gating mechanisms) between specific Working Space Instances (WSI) responsible for the self-model and reality model, and sensory input or emotional processing modules**.
  - **Isolation of Self-Model WSI**: There exists a WSI responsible for constructing and maintaining the self-model. In depersonalization, the information transfer efficiency between this WSI and real-time information flow from bodily sensations, emotional processing modules, or episodic memory is significantly reduced. The self-model WSI cannot receive sufficiently rich, real-time information to update and anchor the sense of self, leading to a feeling of detachment from oneself.
  - **Isolation of Reality Model WSI**: There exists a WSI responsible for constructing and maintaining the model of external reality. In derealization, the information transfer efficiency between this WSI and information flow from sensory input modules is reduced, or its connection with emotional evaluation modules is weakened. Information from the external world is not fully integrated or given emotional salience, leading to a feeling that the world is unreal or distant.
  - **Inhibition or Alteration of Prediction Error**: The system may, through some mechanism (possibly to cope with overwhelming emotions or trauma), **inhibit or alter** prediction error signals related to these WSIs. For example, prediction errors for bodily sensations are inhibited, leading to a feeling of not truly existing in one's body.
  - **Altered Neural Gating Mechanisms Between WSIs**: The neural gating mechanisms between WSIs responsible for the self or reality model and other WSIs (e.g., emotional WSI, behavioral planning WSI) may be altered, limiting information sharing, leading to a separation of feeling and action.

### 6. Clinical Neurocomputational Interpretation: Application of IPWT in Special States of Consciousness

This chapter applies the IPWT framework to various special states of consciousness, demonstrating its powerful explanatory power in clinical neuroscience.

#### 6.1. Redefining the Hard Problem of Qualia: From Phenomenology to Functional Label Problem

Qualia refers to subjective, intrinsic sensory experiences, such as what red feels like, or what pain feels like. It is considered the hard problem of consciousness, meaning that even if we fully understand the physical mechanisms of the brain, we cannot explain why these subjective experiences exist. IPWT does not directly solve the ontological problem of Qualia, but rather **fundamentally redefines and operationalizes it**, treating it as a **Functional Label Problem**. This perspective emphasizes the functional role of Qualia, rather than its irreducible subjectivity.

- **Qualia as Higher-Order Internal Representations of the System**: IPWT posits that Qualia are not useless epiphenomena, but higher-order representations of the system's own state and environmental interactions when information is integrated in the WSI. The subjective feeling of this representation is a functional label generated by the system to optimize its predictions and actions.
- **Functional Explanation**: Qualia have important functional roles. For example, the Qualia of pain is a **strong, undeniable internal feedback** generated when the system's prediction error signal for bodily damage is highly integrated and broadcast in the WSI. This feedback aims to force the system to take action to minimize this error, thereby protecting itself. The Qualia of red is an efficient, integrated internal representation of a specific wavelength of light, capable of quickly triggering relevant associations and behaviors (e.g., stop or danger). The intensity and nature of Qualia are closely related to the magnitude of prediction error, the efficiency of information integration, and its causal impact on system behavior. IPWT further proposes that Qualia can be understood as a **Query Act** (Harris, 2025), meaning an active internal exploration and representation of the system's own state and environment, performed to minimize prediction error and optimize the internal model.
- **Information Compression and Salience**: Qualia can be viewed as an efficient **information compression and salience marker**. Complex sensory inputs are compressed into a single Qualia with strong subjective color, thereby gaining priority in the WSI and quickly attracting the system's attention and response. This compression allows the system to process the most critical information with minimal computational resources.
- IPWT treats Qualia as a functional label problem, aiming to provide an operable framework to study its function and neurocomputational basis, but this does not directly solve the ontological essence of subjective experience. The **Qualia Space Computational Framework** (Fleming & Shea, 2024) is highly consistent with IPWT's functional label theory.

##### 6.1.2. Quantifiable and Manipulable Functional Labels

Through IPWT, we can transform Qualia into **measurable interaction parameters**, thereby moving it from pure philosophical speculation into the realm of experimental research:

- **Integration Latency and Fluency**: The speed and efficiency of information integration in the WSI may affect the fluency of the experience. For example, high integration latency may lead to perceptual stuttering or discomfort, like video playback lag.
- **Prediction Error Rate and Sense of Incongruity**: High prediction error may lead to a sense of incongruity or discomfort in the experience. When the system cannot effectively predict sensory input, the disconnect between its internal model and reality may manifest as an unpleasant Qualia, such as creepiness or dissonance.
- **Salience of Information Unit Set and Vividness**: The salience of the information unit set in the WSI (e.g., its importance in prediction error minimization) may correspond to the vividness or intensity of Qualia. More important information has more vivid Qualia.
- **Experimental Verification Ideas**:
  - **Neuro-interface Manipulation**: Directly manipulate parameters in the IPWT model through advanced neuro-interface technologies. For example, in animal models or clinical trials, by stimulating or inhibiting neural circuits related to WSI routing, change the efficiency of information integration or the transmission of prediction error, and observe its effect on behavior and (if possible) subjective reports (in human subjects). For subjective reports from human subjects, psychophysical scales and more precise experimental designs are needed to reduce subjective bias. For example, by reducing gamma band coherence to simulate a decrease in $\Omega_t$, observe changes in subjects' reported clarity of consciousness.
  - **Computational Model Simulation**: In the computational model of IPWT, systematically change the WSI's integration parameters (e.g., information transfer efficiency, routing algorithms), and observe the Qualia properties reported by the model in simulated tasks (e.g., through the model's classification and response to pain or red, and its internal state's self-organizing patterns).
  - **Psychophysical Experiments**: Design precise psychophysical experiments to manipulate the predictability, complexity, and salience of stimuli, observing their effect on Qualia reports (e.g., intensity, clarity), and correlating them with $\Omega_t$ and PI values in neural activity. For example, by repeatedly presenting predictable stimuli to reduce prediction error, observe its effect on Qualia intensity.

This perspective of treating Qualia as a functional label problem does not deny its subjectivity, but provides an **operable, functional framework** to study it, thereby advancing consciousness research from a metaphysical battlefield to an engineerable domain.

### 7. Discussion and Outlook

IPWT aims to bridge the gap between existing theories of consciousness, providing a unified, computationally feasible, and powerfully explanatory framework.

#### 7.1. Advantages and Limitations of IPWT

- **Advantages**: Theoretical integrability, computational feasibility (through predictive integrity proxy), carrier independence, clinical explanatory power. Its falsifiability is further reflected in an asymmetric prediction: a "seemingly conscious" individual with low ∫PI will be predicted by this theory to be in some verifiable special mental state (e.g., depersonalization), thus becoming a testing ground for the theory; while a "high ∫PI comatose patient" would constitute a fundamental challenge to the theory, but existing PCI evidence already indicates that the latter situation is almost impossible biologically.
- **Limitations**: The hard problem of Qualia still needs deeper exploration; complexity of experimental verification; model refinement still needs improvement.

#### 7.2. Future Research Directions

- **Computational Models and Simulation**: Develop large-scale neurocomputational models based on IPWT to simulate the emergence of consciousness.
- **Neuroscience Experimental Verification**: Utilize fMRI, EEG, and other techniques to find neural correlates of IPWT's core components and verify the relationship between ∫Ω values and consciousness levels.
- **Clinical Application Research**: Develop new DID diagnostic tools and treatment plans based on IPWT.
- **Philosophical and Ethical Discussions**: Delve deeper into IPWT's reshaping of the nature of consciousness, self, and free will.

### 8. Conclusion

The proposal of IPWT marks a shift in the science of consciousness from traditional philosophical speculation and purely neural correlation research to a new paradigm that is more computational, engineerable, and verifiable. It provides a unified language, enabling scientists from different fields to collaborate better and jointly explore the mysteries of consciousness. By viewing consciousness as a computable, verifiable information integration process, IPWT not only provides new tools for understanding human consciousness but also outlines a clear theoretical blueprint for future interventions in mental disorders. This may herald the dawn of a grand unified theory of consciousness, leading us into a new era where we can more profoundly understand the essence of our own existence.
